# FED â€“ Fast & Easy Dispatching

**This is not a template. This is a system.**  
Everything in this repo is custom-built. Every line of logic. Every folder. Every agent. Every route.  
FED is an AI dispatch orchestration platform. Built by one person. Built to run alone. Built to never break.

---

## ðŸš› What Is FED?

FED is an orchestration system for freight dispatchers, agents, and real operators. Itâ€™s not a product. Itâ€™s not a service. Itâ€™s not SaaS.

Itâ€™s the logic, layout, and foundation for running:
- Your own dispatch platform
- Your own agents
- Your own load system
- Your own driver access layer
- Your own infrastructure, if youâ€™re good enough

It runs by protocol.  
Itâ€™s wired by `MARK`.  
And it doesnâ€™t run unless **you do**.

## ðŸ§  What You're Getting

You're getting the full system:
- The FED agent
- The orchestrated tools
- The dispatching logic
- The UI wiring
- The routing brain
- The MARK protocol
- The structure

You're not getting:
- My hosted drivers
- My OpenHighway
- My agents from ELDA or HWY
- My ethics layer

If you want access to that? Build trust. Or build your own.

## ðŸ§­ How It Works

FED is not built on any third-party frontend stack.  
No Solito. No ShadCN. No clone-and-go.  
Itâ€™s built on the MARK system â€” a custom Markdown Agent Routing Kernel â€” that lets agents execute logic through `.mark` and `.marker` files.

Every action, every tool, every UI section is routed through MARK.

---

## ðŸ§© Core Tech

- `MARK`: CLI kernel that routes dispatch commands through Markdown
- `PacketPilot`: Handles broker packet automation
- `CargoConnect`: Parses and structures load boards
- `ELDA`: Driver interface agent (optional â€” controlled)
- `OpenHWY`: License-bound ethics layer (not open source)
- `notebook/`: Every tool, every agent, every piece of logic stored in one structure

Youâ€™re expected to know how to run it. Or learn.

## ðŸ”Œ Host It Yourself

This isnâ€™t click-to-launch.  
This is DevOps, orchestration, AI, and system logic â€” built together.

My stack looks like this:

| Purpose        | Machine/Infra       |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Inference      | Lenovo (OpenVINO)   |
| Training       | ASUS (PyTorch/CUDA) |
| Production     | Linode              |
| Scale/Flex     | DigitalOcean        |

Tailscale runs my secure tunnels.  
Everything else is **mine** â€” and can be **yours** too if you run it.

## ðŸ”“ License

This repo is MIT.

FED and ELDA are free to use, rebuild, break, rewire, and launch.

OpenHWY is not. OpenHWY is controlled. Because ethics matter more than open source.

## ðŸ§  Final Words

> Iâ€™m not here to sell you a product.  
> Iâ€™m not here to convince you this is good.  
> I built this so I could run my life the way I want â€” and if that helps you, take it.  

Donâ€™t ask for help.  
Donâ€™t expect support.  
You run it, or you donâ€™t.

This system isnâ€™t for everyone.  
Itâ€™s for the ones who build anyway.
