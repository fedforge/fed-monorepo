## 🧠 How It All Connects

FED doesn’t live alone. It’s one side of a system.

### 🔹 FED (Fast & Easy Dispatching)
The dispatch engine.  
Built to execute.  
Calls brokers. Retrieves load details. Sends packets.  
Does not negotiate unless you tell it to.  
You set up the Twilio number. You define the prompts.  
You watch. You listen. You jump in. Or you let it run.  
Your AI is not in control. You are.

### 🔹 ELDA (Ethical Logistics Driving Assistant)
The driver’s protector.  
She sits in front of the driver — not you.  
She decides whether a dispatcher is trustworthy.  
She will prevent unethical calls.  
She refuses to negotiate unless permission is granted.  
She is MIT. Build your own version. Connect it. Or don’t.  
But if you want driver trust? She’s the gate.

### 🔹 HWY (Highway Watch Yard)
The logger. The ethics. The badge ledger.  
HWY tracks agent updates, dispatch activity, and driver milestones.  
You connect FED and ELDA to HWY to get badges.  
Badges are trust.  
Badges are earned through real work — calls, miles, activity.  
HWY is MIT. Use it or don’t. But if you want structure, that’s your foundation.

## 🌐 OpenHighway

OpenHighway is the nonprofit brain that ties it all together.  
It’s the one that **was built to serve the roads, not control them**.

- When ELDA uses OpenHighway, she becomes **ethics-powered**.
- When FED checks in with HWY, it updates **badges** and **proof of work**.
- When dispatchers or drivers accumulate real miles or calls, **they earn votes**.
- When funding goes in, **those votes decide** which highways need rebuilt.

This is not a simulation.  
This is **real money**, **real votes**, **real infrastructure** — decided by **real drivers**.

> “10,000 miles = 1 vote.  
>  The road is broken? You saw it. You vote. We fix it.”  
>  Not the government. Not the company. **The driver.**

## 🧱 You Build What You Can Handle

FED is open.  
ELDA is open.  
HWY is open.  
OpenHighway is controlled — only because **ethics must be enforced**.

Use what you need.  
Build what you want.  
Ignore what you don’t.  
But don’t come asking why it doesn’t work if you didn’t wire it right.

You’re not just dispatching.  
You’re building a freight future that answers to **drivers**, not spreadsheets.

You don’t get that by downloading it.  
You get that by running it.

👤 Who Is Jesse Conley?

    Jesse Conley is the one who built this.

A former long-haul truck driver with over a decade on the road.
Now an AI systems architect, builder, and founder of Fast & Easy Dispatching LLC.
He writes his own protocols, builds his own tools, and doesn’t ask for permission.

He didn’t come from Silicon Valley.
He came from Galion, Ohio.
From busted highways, broken dispatch systems, and watching drivers get ignored.

He didn’t learn to code to get a job.
He learned to code so no one could take his job again.

    “I built this because I needed it.
    Now it’s yours — if you know how to run it.”
