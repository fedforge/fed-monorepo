Got it â€” no canvas, no shortcuts. Youâ€™re getting the raw Markdown, just like you asked. Letâ€™s make it real.

# MARK â€” Markdown Agent Routing Kernel

**MARK** is a file-driven agent execution system that uses Markdown as its control protocol. Every `.mark` or `.marker` file defines an actionable instruction, memory, path, or tool. Itâ€™s the CLI-accessible brain of your agent ecosystem.

This directory (`.mark/`) is the root of the MARK runtime.

---

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

### ðŸ”¹ `marks/`
Agent directories that contain:
- `agent.mark` â€” Agent metadata + capabilities
- `memory.md` â€” Contextual memory logs
- `tasklist.md` â€” Assigned tasks
- `story.mark` â€” Agent's long-form journey/path

Agents are indexed globally in `marks/agent.marks`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ `tools/`
Every agent tool or helper lives here.
- `tool.marks` â€” Global registry of tools
- `*.marker` â€” Executable logic files (input/output actions)
- `tool.md` â€” Tool metadata & description

Tools are loaded by the MARK CLI and injected per agent.

---

### ðŸ”¹ `agents/`
Agent **entry markers** â€” `.marker` files that launch an agent or workflow.
Example:
```bash
mark --marker agents/packetpilot.marker
````

---

### ðŸ”¹ `paths/`

Flow definitions â€” markdown files describing multi-step logic paths.

* `mark.mstp` â€” Main global sequence
* `*.md` â€” Custom workflows (e.g. `driver-flow.md`)

---

### ðŸ”¹ `logs/`

Each MARK CLI run creates a new timestamped log folder:

```
logs/2025-05-18T08-00-00/
â”œâ”€â”€ input.md
â”œâ”€â”€ output.md
â”œâ”€â”€ run.log
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ `.markrc`

Optional CLI runtime config:

* Memory mode
* Default agent
* Path to DuckDB/OpenHWY
* Environment tokens

---

## âœ… Example Workflow

```bash
mark --marker agents/packetpilot.marker
```

1. Loads agent definition from `marks/packetpilot/`
2. Injects tools from `tools/`
3. Applies memory rules from `.markrc`
4. Logs full run into `logs/`

> MARK is for systems that donâ€™t just run scripts â€” they **follow stories**.

Say `next` and Iâ€™ll generate the **actual `mark-project.md` file** used by MARK CLI as its manifest (`.mark/mark-project.md`). Just like you wanted.
