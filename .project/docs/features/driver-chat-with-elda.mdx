# Feature: Driver Chat with ELDA

## Description

**Driver Chat with ELDA** enables your drivers to directly communicate with a built-in AI assistant specialized in safety, training, compliance, and basic dispatch guidance. ELDA is their personal guardian agent — answering questions, flagging risks, and reinforcing proper protocol without human intervention.

This builds trust with fleets, keeps drivers informed, and reduces dispatcher load.
