# Feature: Instant Packet Creation

## Description

**Instant Packet Creation** is powered by PacketPilot — a specialized AI agent that autofills broker or carrier packets using uploaded documents, dispatcher profiles, and known MC data. It enables dispatchers to process new packets in seconds without manual copy-paste or rekeying forms.

This feature is designed to reduce paperwork fatigue, prevent packet rejections, and let users focus on real negotiations.
