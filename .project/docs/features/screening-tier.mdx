# Feature: Screening Tier

## Description

The **Screening Tier** is FED’s AI-powered call analysis system that detects negotiation tactics, broker scripts, tone shifts, and red flags in real-time. Screening minutes are limited by plan, and can be upgraded for deeper engagement and live whispering guidance.

Unlike passive transcription, **screening actively thinks**, listens, and flags tactics while a conversation is happening.

## Core Capabilities

- 🎧 **Active Listening**
  - During broker or dispatcher calls, FED monitors language, pauses, and pricing language
  - Utilizes Whisper + prompt-driven inference to identify tactics

- ⚠️ **Trigger Flagging**
  - Detects known lowball phrases, stall tactics, pressure language, or bait terms
  - Example: “Just call me back in an hour” → flagged as a “Soft Stall”

- 💬 **User Notification**
  - In free and starter tiers: user receives subtle screen highlight, tone, or vibration alert
  - In higher tiers: FED may whisper soft advice (“That’s 23% below lane average”)

- 🧠 **Response Prompting**
  - If user allows, FED may provide quick voice/text options like:
    - “Ask if it includes FSC.”
    - “Confirm detention policy.”
    - “Decline. Ask for revised offer.”

## OpenHWY Integration

- All screened call logs (if stored) are hashed and indexed in OpenHWY for audit and legal compliance
- Screening alerts can trigger regulation-based warnings (e.g., ELDA detects risk of misclassification)
