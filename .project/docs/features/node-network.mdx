# Feature: Node Network

## Description

The **Node Network** is FED’s distributed knowledge-sharing layer. It allows agents like PacketPilot, CargoConnect, and ELDA to make smarter decisions based on anonymized, consented user data shared across the platform.

Users opt-in to become “Nodes” in the network, meaning their activity (e.g., rate history, load success, document templates) can be stored and reused by others — securely, privately, and with full transparency.

---

## Core Functions

- 📡 **Rate Memory**
  - Users who opt in to the Node Network help build a live map of rates, broker patterns, lane consistency, and negotiation outcomes.

- 📁 **Packet Script Caching**
  - Once a packet has been filled by a user, its structure and logic are saved and reused — other users receive prefilled packets instantly if a match is found.

- 📖 **Form Intelligence**
  - Every form filled trains the system (without PII) to better identify layout, label intent, field types, and submission strategy.

- 🧠 **Local-Only + Shared Modes**
  - Users can keep all memory local (on device, DuckDB), or opt to share into the network pool
  - Shared memory is used to improve matching, autofill, and alerting across users

---

## Legal and Consent Model

- 🚫 No data is ever shared without **explicit opt-in**
- 🔒 All shared data is **anonymized** (no MCs, names, addresses)
- ✅ Users can revoke Node status at any time
- 🧾 Every Node interaction is logged to `OpenHWY` for traceability

## Example Use Cases

| Agent | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **PacketPilot** | Fills a form instantly using a cached script from another user |
| **CargoConnect** | Alerts a driver that a broker offered higher rates yesterday |
| **Fed** | Hears negotiation tone and checks if that same script pattern was flagged by others |
| **ELDA** | Warns user that a load was rejected previously for being unsafe or mismatched equipment |

---

## Community Dynamics

- Users can:
  - Join **node groups** (e.g., “Dry Van Solo Ops Midwest”)
  - Get benefits like faster scripts, rate trends, better safety alerts
  - Get credit rewards for contributions

- FED can:
  - Prioritize node-connected users for packet fill requests
  - Build rate reports and dashboards powered by real usage

## Storage & Logic

| Layer | Engine |
|-------|--------|
| Memory | `DuckDB` |
| Kernel | `MARK` (Markdown Agent Routing Kernel) |
| Tasks | `Ray` |
| Consent Enforcement | `OpenHWY` (or ELDA) |
