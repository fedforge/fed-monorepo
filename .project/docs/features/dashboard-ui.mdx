# Feature: Dashboard UI

## Description

The **Dashboard UI** is the central interface for all users in the FED platform. It visually reflects real-time status, AI activity, tool access, agent switching, and dispatcher operations. Inspired by high-end SaaS dashboards and TMS systems, the layout is optimized for speed, clarity, and intelligent UI reactions based on agent behavior and user tier.

The UI is responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop — built with **ShadCN**, **Solito**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Expo**.

## Core Sections

### 📍 Sidebar (Bubble Switcher)
- Displays agent icons (FED, PacketPilot, CargoConnect, ELDA, MARK, OpenHWY)
- Clicking a bubble toggles the active agent
- Sidebar collapses or slides depending on user interaction (hover, tap, swipe)
- Powered-by icon (e.g., “Powered by MARK”) appears at the top

### 🧭 Top Bar
- Shows active domain (e.g., `fedispatching.com`)
- Light/dark mode toggle
- Search insights bar (“Try searching ‘my recent calls’”)
- Current agent’s status chip (e.g., “Listening”, “Idle”, “Analyzing”)

### 📦 Main Panel
- Dynamically changes based on current agent view:
  - **PacketPilot**: Show recent packets, fill request queue
  - **CargoConnect**: Connected load boards, load matches
  - **ELDA**: Driver safety alerts, flag reviews
  - **OpenHWY**: Record viewer, audit logs, retention summary

- Real-time components (WebSocket updates or Ray background sync)

### 📊 Insight Cards
- Metrics auto-generate based on active plan + current activity
- Examples:
  - “3 New Load Offers”
  - “2 Broker Calls Flagged”
  - “1 Packet Autofilled”

### ⚙️ Footer Strip (for Boss+ tiers)
- Quick actions:
  - “Start Call Listening”
  - “Log Rate”
  - “Screen Broker”
  - “Submit Packet”
