# Feature: Multimodal Dispatch View

## Description

**Multimodal Dispatch View** lets users run FED from any interface — web, mobile, or terminal — with full feature parity. The platform is designed for real dispatchers working in real-world environments: phones in the cab, laptops at home, tablets in the office, and terminals in the cloud.

The UI adapts across device types without compromising functionality or speed.

  - Swipeable agent tabs (FED, PacketPilot, ELDA)
  - Background sync + offline support
  - Driver and dispatcher views

- 🖲️ **Terminal CLI**
  - Supports agent control via command line (MARK)
  - Example:
    ```bash
    mark --run packetpilot.mark --mode fill --input packet.pdf

## Use Case Examples

- Dispatcher on desktop filling packets → gets call → opens mobile view, FED whispers real-time response
- Driver logs in via mobile → sees load timeline → marks BOL as uploaded
- Boss plan user runs `MARK` on a Raspberry Pi → dispatches 5 loads with Whisper CLI
