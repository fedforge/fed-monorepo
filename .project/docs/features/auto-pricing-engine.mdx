# Feature: Auto Pricing Engine

## Description

The **Auto Pricing Engine** compares real-time market rates, client-specific goals, equipment types, and route difficulty to calculate optimal profit margins for each load. It allows dispatchers to price with confidence — whether countering broker offers or bidding proactively.

This feature integrates with Rate Memory, Load Sync, and OpenHWY data to create strategic price suggestions based on actual market patterns, not guesswork.

## Core Capabilities

- 📊 **Lane-Based Rate Estimation**
  - Calculates average price per mile based on origin, destination, day of week, and equipment
  - Uses past rate history from Rate Memory + Node Network (if enabled)

- 🧮 **Profit Targeting**
  - Dispatcher can define desired margin (e.g. 15%)
  - Suggests minimum viable rate to meet that target based on fuel costs, miles, and deadhead

- 🧠 **Smart Counter Offers**
  - If a broker offer is received, FED auto-generates a response:
    > “$425 below lane average — suggest counter at $2.88/mile with fuel inclusion.”

- 🔎 **Market Volatility Adjustment**
  - Adjusts output if current region is high-competition or low-demand
  - Pulls recent rejection rates and rate compression data

## Use Case Example

1. Load from ATL → CHI appears at $1.87/mile  
2. FED checks:
   - Lane average = $2.35/mile
   - Driver’s profit goal = 20%
   - Broker’s past average = $2.45/mile  
3. FED recommends:  
   > “Counter at $2.48/mile. Justified by lane average and broker precedent.”
