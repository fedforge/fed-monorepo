# Feature: AI Broker Conversations

## Description

**AI Broker Conversations** allows FED to communicate directly with brokers on the user's behalf — via email or phone — using preset negotiation prompts and the dispatcher’s own tone and language style. FED can whisper back suggestions, generate rebuttals, or even simulate full calls in advanced plans.

This feature transforms brokers from obstacles into automated negotiations, all powered by your preferences.

## Core Capabilities

- 📞 **AI-Powered Phone Calls**
  - FED uses Twilio or Whisper to listen to live broker calls and optionally respond
  - Dispatcher can choose to have FED whisper insights or fully simulate their voice style

- 📧 **Email Negotiation Assistant**
  - FED can write, format, and send emails to brokers using dispatcher presets
  - Language tone (polite, firm, aggressive) is configurable by user profile

- 🧠 **Tone-Matching Model**
  - FED mirrors the user’s negotiation style based on stored call patterns and prompt presets
  - Broker-specific memory enables smart follow-ups and reminders

- 🔐 **Voice Privacy**
  - FED never uses actual user audio unless authorized
  - Voice cloning is optional and only enabled for Boss+ plans with custom TTS models

## Example Scenarios

- Broker sends rate confirmation with lowball offer  
  → FED auto-replies with counter and justifying rate based on memory

- Dispatcher presses “Call”  
  → FED opens call window, listens live, and whispers intelligent prompts

- Caller stalls  
  → FED detects and suggests: “Offer $250 more or request FSC”

## Permissions & Consent

- All calls and emails are sent only with dispatcher approval
- FED’s whisper/voice AI respects `.consent.md` settings
- Stored call summaries or broker responses require explicit storage opt-in
