# Feature: Real-Time Load Sync

## Description

**Real-Time Load Sync** allows FED and CargoConnect to continuously pull, parse, and display load data from connected load boards and internal APIs. Loads appear instantly inside the dashboard, allowing dispatchers to assign, filter, or match without toggling platforms.

This system turns third-party boards into a unified dispatch feed, powered by user credentials or embedded API contracts.
