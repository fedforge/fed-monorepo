# Feature: TMS Dashboard Integration

## Description

**TMS Dashboard Integration** allows users to either integrate their existing Transportation Management System (TMS) with FED — or use OpenHWY as a drop-in replacement. This enables full load lifecycle management, automated audit trails, and deep visibility into dispatch operations, without requiring a third-party SaaS.

OpenHWY acts as the secure, AI-aware TMS backend that keeps all activity logged, structured, and legally referenceable.

## Core Capabilities

- 🔄 **OpenHWY-Native Option**
  - Users without a TMS can activate OpenHWY as their compliance-grade dispatch ledger
  - Auto-logs calls, packets, rates, signatures, and load lifecycle

- 🔗 **TMS Connectors**
  - API bridges to popular TMS platforms (e.g., McLeod, AscendTMS, Tailwind)
  - Syncs load creation, status, and billing records
  - Optional: CSV/Excel drop-in support for lightweight ops

- 🧠 **Agent-Aware Records**
  - Every action taken by PacketPilot, CargoConnect, or ELDA is tied to a record
  - Rate memory, packet fill, call screen, and dispute logs are stored against the load ID

- 🔍 **Full Search + Filters**
  - OpenHWY-powered dashboards let users search across:
    - Past loads
    - Broker contact history
    - Flagged calls
    - Delivered paperwork
    - Dispatcher reputation scores

## Example Scenarios

- Fleet uses Tailwind TMS → FED syncs packet logs + call flags into existing workflow
- Solo dispatcher → activates OpenHWY → every action is stored + timestamped for audit
- Boss plan fleet → sees all dispatcher logs + AI decisions directly inside TMS portal
