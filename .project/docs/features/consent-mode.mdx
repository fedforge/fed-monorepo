# Feature: Consent Mode

## Description

**Consent Mode** is the enforcement layer that ensures every action FED takes — from listening, recording, memory storage, or node sharing — is fully authorized by the user. It is designed to give users full control over what data is captured, stored, shared, or used to train AI agents.

Consent Mode sits at the core of the legal and ethical foundation of the FED platform.

## Consent Categories

FED supports **granular, user-controlled consent toggles** for:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🎧 Call Listening | Allows FED to transcribe phone calls in real-time via Whisper |
| 🧠 Memory Logging | Allows transcribed call summaries or rate data to be stored locally |
| 🌐 Node Sharing | Allows anonymized data to be used across the FED community |
| 🗣️ AI Prompt Training | Allows call snippets or summary logs to be reused to improve prompt quality |
| 🛠️ Agent Improvements | Allows anonymized feedback to improve PacketPilot, ELDA, etc. behavior |

---

## Consent UI (Dashboard)

Each user has a **Consent Panel** in their dashboard with toggle switches like:

- ✅ “Allow Whisper call transcription”
- ✅ “Allow anonymized memory storage in DuckDB”
- ❌ “Share my packet templates with the Node Network”
- ✅ “Use my broker interaction history to improve FED screening accuracy”

Changes are:
- Logged instantly in OpenHWY for audit
- Revocable at any time
- Honored in real-time across all tools

## Enforcement & Logging

| Component | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **OpenHWY** | Tracks consent log entries and revocation events |
| **ELDA** | Denies unauthorized agent actions and enforces compliance |
| **MARK** | Reads `.consent.md` into every agent's environment context before execution |
| **DuckDB** | Will not store any fingerprinted data unless consent is on file |

---

## Plan-Level Defaults

| Plan | Defaults |
|------|----------|
| **Free** | Call listening on, no storage, no node sharing |
| **Starter** | Selective memory logging, optional node share |
| **Pro** | Full access, AI feedback allowed |
| **Boss** | Auto-enrollment in memory, node, and intelligent whispering unless opted out manually |
