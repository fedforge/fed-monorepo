# Feature: Dispatcher Reputation System

## Description

The **Dispatcher Reputation System** allows dispatchers on FED to build a performance-based profile — rated not by paperwork or MCs, but by actual dispatching results. It brings transparency, accountability, and recognition into an industry where trust is earned through action.

Both brokers and drivers can optionally submit feedback, and FED uses internal metrics to reinforce skill-based ranking.

## Core Capabilities

- ⭐ **Skill-Based Reputation**
  - Dispatchers are rated based on:
    - Packet accuracy
    - Call screening quality
    - On-time delivery rates
    - Agent efficiency (time-to-fill, response rate)
  - Drivers and brokers can leave 1–5 star feedback after loads

- 📈 **Progressive Score Decay**
  - Reputation scores slowly decay over time without usage
  - Encourages active dispatching and reduces ghost profiles

- 🧠 **AI-Verified Metrics**
  - ELDA and PacketPilot both verify data consistency before accepting ratings
  - Prevents fake reviews or malicious downvoting

- 🛡️ **Anonymous Ratings (Optional)**
  - Reviewers may choose to stay anonymous
  - Dispatchers can challenge inaccurate scores via OpenHWY logs
