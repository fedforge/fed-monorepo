# Feature: Customizable Tools per Fleet

## Description

**Customizable Tools per Fleet** gives dispatchers, fleet owners, and account admins the power to personalize the FED dashboard per user, team, or business unit. It allows for enabling/disabling tools, rebranding sections, and applying permission-based access to PacketPilot, CargoConnect, ELDA, and more.

The system supports white-labeling for enterprise dispatchers and fine-grained control for growing fleets.

## Core Capabilities

- 🧩 **Tool Visibility Controls**
  - Toggle visibility of specific agents/tools: PacketPilot, CargoConnect, ELDA, Rate Memory, Screening, etc.
  - Set visibility by dispatcher, role, or company tier

- 🏷️ **Fleet Branding**
  - Customize dashboard colors, logo, agent names (e.g. rename “ELDA” to “CoachBot”)
  - Supports white-label mode for enterprise

- 🔐 **Role-Based Permissions**
  - Admins assign roles (e.g., junior dispatcher, senior dispatcher, auditor)
  - Each role has predefined access to tools, APIs, and dashboards

- 🧠 **Usage Analytics**
  - FED tracks which tools are used most by each role/fleet
  - Admins can adjust available tools based on performance

---

## Example Use Cases

- A solo dispatcher hides ELDA and CargoConnect to keep interface minimal
- A large fleet gives dispatchers access to PacketPilot only, and managers access to ELDA’s safety dashboard
- A white-labeled instance shows only branding for the client fleet (“SpeedHaul Dispatch” instead of FED)
