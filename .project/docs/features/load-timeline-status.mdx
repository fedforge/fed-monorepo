# Feature: Load Timeline & Status

## Description

**Load Timeline & Status** is a real-time monitoring system that tracks each load from assignment to delivery, combining driver check-ins, broker communication, AI-flagged events, and geographic progress. It allows dispatchers and fleets to visualize the full lifecycle of a load in one clean interface — from quote to delivery.

This feature works across web, mobile, and offline-sync environments to ensure visibility regardless of location.

## Core Capabilities

- 🛰️ **Live Location Tracking**
  - Integrates with mobile app GPS (via Expo) to update dispatcher on driver’s position
  - Displays location, ETA, and time since last check-in

- 📬 **Email + Call Ingestion**
  - Pulls relevant load updates from broker emails or call transcriptions
  - Detects mentions of changes, delays, cancellations, etc.

- 🧠 **AI Delay Flagging**
  - ELDA listens for language in calls/emails that implies risk
  - Examples: “gate’s closed,” “won’t be ready until tomorrow,” “driver didn’t call”

- 📆 **Load Lifecycle Timeline**
  - Shows each step:
    - Load offered
    - Load accepted
    - Packet sent
    - Driver assigned
    - En route
    - Delivered
    - Ratecon received
    - Invoiced

- 📥 **Status Card Rendering**
  - Dispatchers and drivers both see visual status cards with timestamps and auto-notes

## Driver Visibility

- Drivers see:
  - Next stop + deadline
  - Status log of current load
  - Estimated pay amount (optional)
- Drivers can trigger:
  - “Running Late” or “Load Delivered” pings
  - Proof of delivery photo upload
