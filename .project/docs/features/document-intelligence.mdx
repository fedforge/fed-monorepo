# Feature: Document Intelligence

## Description

**Document Intelligence** enables FED to read, understand, and extract structured data from complex logistics paperwork — including rate cons, packets, bills of lading (BOLs), COIs, W9s, and broker onboarding forms. It combines OCR (optical character recognition) with GPT-based layout parsing to convert unstructured PDFs into clean JSON ready for automation.

This is the core vision layer behind PacketPilot and form automation workflows.

## Core Capabilities

- 👁️ **Visual Parsing**
  - Uses OCR to extract text from scanned or image-based documents (Tesseract or Vision API)
  - GPT-based inference tags field meanings (e.g. “Pickup Location”, “Rate”, “Accessorials”)

```

- 📄 **Document-to-JSON Conversion**
  - Standardizes rate cons, onboarding packets, and other forms into normalized JSON
  - Enables autofill, packet scripting, and AI-driven response

- 🔍 **Auto Field Matching**
  - Links recognized fields to dispatcher profile fields or company MC# records
  - Can learn from correction and build improved confidence over time

- 🔐 **Secure, Local-First Option**
  - All documents are processed locally by default unless user enables cloud fallback
  - No document data is used for training unless consent is explicitly given
