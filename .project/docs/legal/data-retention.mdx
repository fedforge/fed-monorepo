# Data Retention Policy – Fast & Easy Dispatching LLC

**Effective Date:** [To Be Filled]

---

## Overview

This policy describes how long Fast & Easy Dispatching LLC (“FED”, “we”, “our”) retains various types of data across the platform — including documents, logs, metadata, agent actions, and AI-generated outputs.

We believe that users should control their data, and storage should be limited to only what is necessary, legal, or explicitly requested.

## Archive Storage Policy

- When active data passes its 7-day live period, it enters **archived mode** for up to 90 days.
- Archived data is not editable, but can be viewed or exported.
- Archived storage is only available to **paying users** (Starter, Pro, Boss).
- Users on the **Free plan** must export or upgrade before data deletion.

---

## Data Deletion & Expiration

After 90 days in archive (or if a user downgrades or cancels):

- Data exceeding plan limits may be **purged permanently**
- You will receive warning notifications via dashboard/email prior to deletion
- Deleted data cannot be recovered

Users may delete any document, task, or log at any time using dashboard controls or by submitting a request.

---

## Custom Retention Settings

Users may define their own retention window per data type in account settings or via API.

Examples:
- Retain dispatch logs for 30 days
- Delete documents after 14 days
- Keep ELDA agent history for 90 days

If no custom setting is selected, FED defaults to **7 days active / 90 days archive**.

---

## Legal Recordkeeping

You are solely responsible for maintaining legal records required by FMCSA, DOT, brokers, or your company.

FED does not guarantee retention of legally required documents unless explicitly contracted (e.g., under Boss or custom plan).

---

## Signature Storage

All digital signatures are stored in OpenHWY and retained indefinitely unless a deletion request is submitted by the account owner.

Each signature is hashed, timestamped, and linked to the signer’s identity and agent routing source.
