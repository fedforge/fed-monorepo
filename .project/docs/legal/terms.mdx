# Terms of Service – Fast & Easy Dispatching LLC

**Effective Date:** [To Be Filled]

---

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using any part of the Fast & Easy Dispatching (“FED”) platform — including PacketPilot, CargoConnect, ELDA, or any associated tools, dashboards, or APIs — you agree to be legally bound by these Terms of Service.

If you do not agree to all terms outlined here, you may not use the platform or its services.

---

## 2. License to Use

You are granted a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use the FED software and agent tools for lawful dispatching, form automation, logistics coordination, and driver support.

You may not resell, clone, sublicense, or reverse-engineer any part of this system without written permission.

---

## 3. Agent Authorization and AI Consent

### By using this system, you acknowledge:

- You may choose to authorize AI agents to act on your behalf, such as submitting packets, signing forms, or generating dispatch documents.
- You must explicitly approve any AI agent that performs a legal or signature-bearing action (e.g., PacketPilot signing a rate confirmation).
- Once granted, AI authorization is logged in OpenHWY and legally binding unless revoked.
- You are responsible for any documents submitted through your authenticated session or API key.

### Digital Power of Attorney (Boss Plan):

Users subscribed to the Boss tier may optionally issue a digital power of attorney (POA) to PacketPilot or other agents. This POA authorizes those agents to auto-sign documents, generate and dispatch packets, and engage APIs under the scope of your platform credentials.

All digital POAs are stored permanently in OpenHWY and linked to your user ID, timestamp, and signature.

---

## 4. OpenAI Fallback (Emergency AI Handling)

If local AI agents fail or experience a service outage, OpenHWY may automatically escalate a task to OpenAI’s API infrastructure — but **only if you have explicitly enabled fallback permission** in your account settings.

We do not send personal user metadata unless it has been stripped, encrypted, or transformed into non-identifiable structures.

---

## 5. Storage, Logging, and Retention

- All agent activity, form data, and signatures are logged in OpenHWY.
- By default, records are stored for **7 days active**, and up to **90 days archived**.
- Extended storage is only provided to paying users.
- Signature logs are retained indefinitely unless deletion is requested.
- Users may define retention policies through dashboard settings or API flags.

You are responsible for retaining your own legal records (e.g., broker agreements, dispatch orders, rate cons) unless explicitly subscribed to a plan that includes full archival storage.

---

## 6. Downgrades & Deactivation

- Downgrading your plan (e.g., from Pro to Free) may result in **loss of access to AI agents**, **data storage limits**, and **feature restrictions**.
- Data exceeding your current plan’s quota may be **archived for up to 90 days**, then **deleted permanently** if no upgrade or export action is taken.
- We are not liable for deleted data following a plan downgrade unless storage was contractually guaranteed.

---

## 7. Refund Policy

FED does not offer refunds once paid access has been used, accessed, or activated. A free tier is provided for all users to evaluate the platform prior to purchase.

Refunds may only be reviewed in cases of:
- Duplicate charges
- Billing system error
- Fraudulent use (with legal report)

No prorated refunds are issued for mid-cycle cancellations.

---

## 8. System Modifications & Terms Changes

We may update these Terms, Privacy Policy, and Service Scope at any time to reflect feature changes, legal requirements, or platform restructuring.

If any material change affects your legal rights, you will be prompted to accept new terms upon next login.

Your continued use after updates constitutes agreement.

---

## 9. Limitation of Liability

FED is not liable for:
- Broker disputes caused by user error
- Incorrect dispatch data submitted via agent tools
- Legal compliance failures from misuse of the platform
- Loss of access or logs after downgrade, expiration, or user deletion

You use all automation tools **at your own risk**, and are responsible for verifying critical documents before submission.

---

## 10. Jurisdiction & Venue

These Terms are governed by the laws of the **State of Ohio**. Any disputes shall be resolved under the jurisdiction of Richland County, Ohio courts, unless preempted by federal law.
