# Privacy Policy – Fast & Easy Dispatching LLC

**Effective Date:** [To Be Filled]

## Overview

This Privacy Policy explains how Fast & Easy Dispatching LLC (“FED”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, stores, and protects information from users of our software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform, including all AI agent tools such as PacketPilot, ELDA, CargoConnect, and the OpenHWY ledger system.

We believe in transparency, sovereignty, and control over your data. This document outlines exactly what we do—and don’t do—with the information you share with us.

---

## Data Collection

We collect and process the following types of data depending on your usage:

- **Basic Account Details**: Name, email, dispatcher or carrier company information, plan tier, and usage status.
- **Uploaded Documents**: Such as broker packets, rate confirmations, carrier packages, and forms (submitted blank or partially filled).
- **Metadata**: Timestamps, device ID, file hashes, upload activity, and internal routing logs.
- **AI Interaction Logs**: Prompt history, agent commands, response summaries, and action execution logs.
- **Optional Storage Data**: If cloud storage is enabled, form responses, signed documents, and logs are retained securely in OpenHWY.

---

## AI Usage & Consent

### Our AI agents include:
- `PacketPilot`
- `CargoConnect`
- `ELDA`
- `MARK`
- (and future tools under the OpenHWY stack)

By default, agents do **not** learn from or retain your personal business data unless you explicitly opt-in.

### We do not:
- Train models on your private data.
- Transmit sensitive fields (e.g. MC#, tax ID, personal emails) unless anonymized.
- Allow third-party access to any stored data without your consent.

### We may:
- Cache and reuse **blank packet templates** and **form structures** to reduce compute time for future users. This includes layout logic, field mappings, and autofill positions.
- Store your command logs and signatures in OpenHWY if you explicitly approve a digital POA (Power of Attorney) or document execution action.

### OpenAI Usage

In the event that local AI systems fail, and only if you've agreed, OpenHWY may escalate processing to OpenAI for fallback purposes. This will only occur if:

- Your system is unable to complete the task locally
- You have enabled fallback permissions
- No personal user data is sent in the escalation request unless stripped or obfuscated

---

## Data Storage & Retention

- **Active Storage**: User-generated logs, forms, and interactions are stored for a minimum of 7 days.
- **Archived Storage**: After 7 days, data moves to archive where it is retained for **up to 90 days**. Extended retention is available to paid users on Pro/Boss plans.
- **Signature Logs**: All digital signatures, authorization timestamps, and POA confirmations are retained in OpenHWY indefinitely unless legally requested for deletion.
- **Cloud Storage (Optional)**: Users may upgrade to encrypted, user-key-accessible cloud storage. We never access these files unless you explicitly grant permission.

---

## User Rights & Controls

You have full control over how your data is stored and used:

- **Export AI Logs**: You may download a full JSON record of your AI interactions, task history, and routing decisions at any time.
- **Delete Records**: You may request deletion of any file, signature, or interaction record that is not legally protected.
- **Retention Settings**: You may define your own retention window (e.g., 7, 30, 60, 90 days) via settings or API request.
- **Privacy Mode**: You may disable all cloud syncing and keep data local to your device. This may limit access to certain features.

---

## Third-Party Services

FED may utilize third-party services for limited backend operations, including:

- **Stripe / PayPal**: for secure billing
- **Cloud storage providers** (e.g. Backblaze, R2) for encrypted data backup
- **OpenAI API**: fallback AI only with opt-in, as described above

We do not sell, rent, or distribute your information to any external party without your explicit consent.

---

## Data Security

We employ:

- End-to-end encryption of all documents and logs
- Hash-based verification of signature inputs
- Signed action tracing in OpenHWY for legal recordkeeping
- Isolated environment execution for AI agent tasks
- User-controlled encryption keys for paid cloud data

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect platform changes, legal updates, or AI scope evolution. Users will be notified and prompted to review any material changes.
