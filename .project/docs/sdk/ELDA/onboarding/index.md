# ELDA Onboarding Index

## Overview

This directory contains every onboarding flow used across the FED ecosystem. These paths are managed by ELDA and executed by MARK to route users, agents, and developers through the correct setup, training, and activation workflows.

Each flow connects back to OpenHWY for compliance, storage, and log management.
