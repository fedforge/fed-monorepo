# PacketPilot Training Flow

## Overview

This onboarding flow is for **new dispatchers**, **VAs**, or **fleet owners** who want to unlock PacketPilot's full automation capabilities.

## Step 5 â€” Unlock Confirmation

Youâ€™ve completed the onboarding and can now:

## Smart Behavior

* If user skips upload, PacketPilot enters "Learning Mode" and requires manual review on every fill
* If user uploads and confirms once, PacketPilot caches the fill strategy by layout type (not content)
* Future uploads of matching layout will auto-trigger script mapping
