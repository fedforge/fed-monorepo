# Storage & Retention Plan

This document outlines the cloud storage strategy, user retention policy, legal notes, and pricing justification for storing logs, metadata, and documents in the FED ecosystem.

## Storage Strategy

- **Primary Storage**: Cloudflare R2 or Backblaze B2 (cheap, reliable object storage)
- **Backup Providers**: Linode S3 or Wasabi for multi-region redundancy
- **Sync Model**: Local-first storage (on device) with scheduled backend sync
- **Compression**: Metadata and logs compressed with JSON + snapshot encoding

## Pricing Example

Assuming each user stores 50MB:

- **10,000 users** x 50MB = 500,000MB = ~488GB
- Estimated monthly cost:
  - Cloudflare R2: ~$7.50/month
  - Backblaze B2: ~$2.50/month

## Justifying User Charges

Users are billed for:
- Cloud document storage
- AI-generated logs and task history
- API backups and synced metadata

### Suggested Model

| Plan         | Included Storage | Cost      |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| Free Tier    | 20MB             | $0        |
| Pro Tier     | 500MB            | $5/month  |
| Enterprise   | Unlimited        | Custom    |

## Legal Considerations

- Users must accept the privacy policy.
- Opt-in for cloud storage must be explicit.
- Logs may be cached locally but always encrypted.
- Terms must state that logs & metadata are retained for security, compliance, and performance.

## Storage Format

- `.mark`, `.md`, `.json`, and `.zip` compressed versions
- Indexed using DuckDB or similar analytics engine
- Metadata is de-duplicated and time-stamped for legal traceability
