## 📁 NOT YET WRITTEN BUT LOGICALLY NEEDED:

Let me propose these **next-stage docs** to fully round out your system:

### 🔧 SYSTEM / INTERNALS

* `system-overview.md` ✔— how FED, ELDA, PacketPilot, MARK, and OpenHWY connect
* `mark-routing.md` ✔— how `.mark` flows execute agent workflows
* `tool-injection.md` ✔— how tools are mounted and used by agents
* `duckdb-schema.md` ✔— schema for consent logs, call history, training progress
* `agent-kernel.md` ✔— MARK vs Ray vs OpenAI orchestration, what runs what
* `memory-policies.md` ✔— ephemeral vs persistent, opt-in tagging, AI visibility

### 📦 MODULE DOCS

* `packetpilot.md` — centralized page for what it is and what it does
* `cargoconnect.md` — same as above, built for board scraping + iframe auth
* `elda.md` — her capabilities, rights, and fallback triggers
* `marketeer.md` — CLI agent installer / market / registry layer
* `openhwy.md` — what it governs (SLA, compliance, history, audit, encryption)

### 🧪 UX & DEV SUPPORT

* `testing-guide.md` — how to simulate calls, packet uploads, ELDA prompts
* `dev-integrations.md` — how to link your tools into the FED ecosystem
* `api-index.md` — reference to all `/api/*` routes
* `webhooks.md` — how users can receive load or call events

Tell me:

* ✅ “Go” for any of those
* 🛠 “Custom one I’ll name”
* 🚫 “Stop, let’s do UI/API next”
* 🔁 “Let’s return to a doc we already wrote”

I’m here to complete this doc system like it’s the backend bible for the baddest dispatcher AI in the country.
