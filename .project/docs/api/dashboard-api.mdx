# API: Dashboard API

## Description

The **Dashboard API** powers all real-time interactions between FEDâ€™s front-end UI and its backend services. This API acts as the connective layer between user actions, agent status updates, live load data, and Whisper/PacketPilot activity logs.

The Dashboard API is built with FastAPI, designed for high concurrency and scalable event-based communication (WebSockets, async REST).

## Core Endpoints

### ðŸŸ¢ Agent Status

```http
GET /api/agent/status
````

* Returns the currently active agent (e.g., `fed`, `packetpilot`, `cargoconnect`)
* Returns activity status: `idle`, `listening`, `filling`, `paused`, `responding`

---

### ðŸŸ£ Active Screen

```http
POST /api/dashboard/view
```

**Body:**

```json
{
  "agent": "fed",
  "view": "calls"
}
```

* Updates the currently active dashboard panel
* Used to sync the UI tab display (loads, calls, forms, settings)

---

### ðŸ”„ Insight Metrics

```http
GET /api/insights/summary
```

* Returns dynamic data cards:

  * Total loads matched today
  * Packets autofilled
  * Calls flagged by screening
  * Whisper memory alerts

---

### ðŸ“‚ Whisper Logs (Boss plan only)

```http
GET /api/whisper/recent
```

* Returns last 10 Whisper summaries (if storage is permitted)
* Each log includes:

  * Call ID
  * Summary
  * Flag triggers
  * Timestamps

---

### ðŸ“¥ Action Queue

```http
GET /api/queue/actions
```

* Returns all pending user actions (e.g., "Fill packet for broker X", "Review flagged call")

---

### ðŸ§  Node Memory Ping

```http
POST /api/node/rate-check
```

**Body:**

```json
{
  "origin": "Atlanta, GA",
  "destination": "Chicago, IL",
  "broker_alias": "FastFreight"
}
```

* Checks Node memory (if enabled) for recent rate trends or flags
* Returns:

  * Average lane rate
  * Last known broker behavior
  * Alert level (none / yellow / red)

---

## Auth & Permissions

All Dashboard API endpoints use:

* JWT token (user login)
* Agent-level scopes (`read:status`, `write:view`, `read:queue`)
* Consent checks via `.consent.md` and OpenHWY middleware
* Whisper, Node, and Screening endpoints are disabled unless enabled by plan

# Dashboard API

## Overview

The FED Dashboard API powers all authenticated user interactions with the frontend web app. This includes:

- Loading dispatcher data
- Handling tool usage (PacketPilot, CargoConnect, ELDA)
- Triggering Whisper listening and call detection
- Fetching agent memory
- Executing API logic routed through MARK or directly via FastAPI

---

## Authentication

All dashboard API routes require:

- JWT bearer token from login
- User role context (dispatcher, owner-op, broker)
- Optional session key (for live memory)

```http
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
````

---

## Core Routes

| Route                               | Method | Description                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `/api/dashboard/me`                 | GET    | Get current user profile and plan         |
| `/api/dashboard/agents`             | GET    | List available agents + status            |
| `/api/dashboard/tools/{id}/trigger` | POST   | Trigger tool execution from UI            |
| `/api/dashboard/loadboard`          | GET    | Return user-specific CargoConnect loads   |
| `/api/dashboard/call/log`           | POST   | Submit a Whisper call transcript + tags   |
| `/api/dashboard/memory`             | POST   | Inject memory context into active session |

---

## Sample: Fetch Dashboard Tools

```http
GET /api/dashboard/agents
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

```json
[
  {
    "id": "packetpilot",
    "status": "ready",
    "last_used": "2025-05-18T17:01:00Z"
  },
  {
    "id": "elda",
    "status": "active"
  }
]
```

---

## Triggering Tool from UI

```http
POST /api/dashboard/tools/packetpilot/trigger
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "ratecon": "data:application/pdf;base64,..."
  },
  "context": {
    "session": "session_78912",
    "plan": "pro"
  }
}
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "output_url": "/downloads/filled-packet-1099.json"
}
```

---

## Whisper-Driven Call Logging

This endpoint is used by the Whisper agent when a dispatcher finishes a call:

```http
POST /api/dashboard/call/log
```

```json
{
  "transcript": "Yeah, I can move it for $1800...",
  "broker": "TQL",
  "rate": "$1800",
  "tags": ["lowball", "emotional-language"],
  "tool": "whisper-alerts"
}
```

---

## Agent Memory Sync

```http
POST /api/dashboard/memory
```

```json
{
  "agent": "packetpilot",
  "key": "recent_rate_window",
  "value": {
    "origin": "Dallas, TX",
    "destination": "Charlotte, NC",
    "range": "$1650 - $1900"
  }
}
```
